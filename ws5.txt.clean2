Slightly reminiscent of Harlan Coben's recent novels...a basically decent guy caught up in circumstances beyond his control, fighting to redeem himself.  There was a misspelled word and a grammatical error on the very first page, and I was worried the book would be unreadable.  But, the story took off and if there were errors, I didn't notice them.  I think a lot of people read books like this for a peek into the highlife and there is a bit of that here.  The pace moves along at a good clip.  The plot is a good one and leads to a very exciting conclusion.  At times, the story becomes a little too cute, especially where FBI agent Ellie Shurtleff [1;61r[60;47H[1;60r[23S[37;47His concerned.

It's as if the author thought the reader would have trouble following the story if she didn't repeat the steps in the plot at every turn.

A steady diet of Stephanie Plum could prove tiring, but one episode a year is a nice break from the darker entries in the available fiction.[5C2005-07-06

The sex and violence in this one is pretty hard to take at times.  Definitely not a book for the squeamish. Some of the procedural was a little tedious, but overall, the pace moved along a very good clip, which led to a very exciting conclusion.

But Sandford, as usual, makes this about the characters and not shadowy governmental machinations.  There is hum[1;61r[60;63H[1;60r[23S[37;63Hor here.  Some of it is laugh out loud.  The story is not especially suspenseful.  The reader is in on the plot from the beginning.  What makes it interesting is how Davenport and his team put it all together.

The case that Harry and Rider are working is the seventeen-year-old murder of a young girl.  Before too long, Bosch realizes that Irving probably had a hand in derailing the original investigation.  There are plenty of twists and turn and misdirection. The pace never lets up and leads to a very satisfying conclusion.  As always, Connelly has police procedure down to a fine art.

Meanwhile, back in New Jersey, A woman detective agrees to help a Mother Superior discover why a recently deceased nun was found to have had breast implants.

Meantime, Jimmy Joe Lane has escaped from prison again and has convinced himself that he and Jo Beth are meant for each other.  His views on courting Jo Beth are bizarre, to put it mildly.

The Yosemite Valley in November is dark and dreary and Barr's usual sparkling landscape descriptions reflected the dismal weather.  The mystery is a good one and the story moves along at a good clip.

Lawrence Ritter has made a Herculean effort tracking down all these players and getting their stories.  Baseball fans owe him many thanks for the job he's done.  There are many interesting stories told between these pages, but one of the most surprising to me was that these players called the games themselves most of the time.  No coaches and the managers sat back and let the players play, for the most part.  I especially enjoyed the story by Rube Bressler about three players ending up on third base at the same time.  This is a must have collection for baseball fans.  I thought \\"The Greatest Baseball Stories Ever Told\\" by Jeff Silverman was a little more entertaining, but this collection held my interest too and is a book worth keeping.[5C2005-05-12

It's different from other novels where my imagination is needed to bring the characters to life.  I've seen and come to like these characters from watching them on TV.  What is even better, in these stories the team is still working together and not split up like they are now in the TV series.  In this outing Gil Grissom arrives at a crime scene with his team to find a murder victim that looks very similar to several murders from 10 years ago that were never solved.  Is the killer back or is this a copycat?  The resolution is more procedural than suspenseful, but satisfying nevertheless.  If you enjoy the TV series CSI, you should really treat yourself to these books.  The stories are all original and not copied from the shows on TV.  Now if someone would do for ER (my other favorite TV show) what Max Collins has done for CSI, I would be a very happy camper.[7C2005-04-27

I am a baseball fan, but I'm not especially learned in baseball history.  These stories, all by a different author, have deepened my love for the game and engendered appreciation for the men who play the game, past and present.  I admit up front that I am a die-hard Dodger fan.  The chapter by Vin Scully on Sandy Kofax's perfect game gave me goose bumps.  I learned my love of baseball from my father, so the chapter by Doris Kearns Goodwin was especially meaningful (brought tears to my eyes).  She tells how her father taught her to keep a score book for the Brooklyn Dodger games, then relay to him, play by play the entire game when he came home from work.  She tells how, when the score was close toward the end of a game, she had to ask her mother to take notes while she left the room because the anxiety was just too much to bear.  I, too, have had to do this.  Of course, the first chapter with Abbott and Costello's \\"Who's On First\\" is a classic whether you are a baseball fan or not.  I enjoyed every page of this book and plan to pass it along to grandkids who also love the game of baseball.[5C2005-04-25

After just a few pages, I was reminded why she is one of my favorite authors.  Park ranger Anna Pigeon has been transferred to Fort Jefferson on Garden Key, a small island fort that was used as a prison during the Civil War.  Anna's great, great aunt Raffia was the wife of the Captain of the fort and Anna has th[1;61r[60;169H[1;60r[23S[37;169He letters Raffia wrote home to her sister telling her about her life in the fort.  While Anna investigates a boat explosion off shore, she is also deeply into Raffia's letters and the reader gets two good stories for the price of one.  With some authors, landscape descriptions can be tedious and even annoying, but Barr is a master at this and her descriptions are so rich and real they transport the reader effortlessly to the places in the story.  From diving amongst the coral reefs to walking the parade ground of the fort during the Civil War the stories unravel.  The danger in Anna's and the danger in Raffia's world increase page by page until the suspense is almost unbearable.  This book goes to the top of my Nevada Barr favorites list.[8C2005-04-08

But before Josef Tock passed on, he made several predictions.  He told Jimmy's father that there would be 5 terrible days in his son's life and even gave him the dates. <br /> <br />On the first of the terrible days, Jimmy finds himself in a bank and disaster soon follows.  The dialog in this particular part of the book was so silly it almost defeated me.  I put the book down and it was several weeks before I could bring myself to resume reading.  I remember a bit of this type of silliness in Odd Thomas, but in this story, it was almost overwhelming.  However, when I did get past the bank scene, the story improved quite a bit.  There were plenty of edge of your seat, heart-pounding moments that led to a very surprising ending. <br /> <br />Of course the whole premise is highly improbable.  It did spring, after all, from the fertile imagination of Dean Koontz.  I just wish Koontz would leave the humor to authors like Janet Evanovich and stick to what he does best...good old fashion scary tales. <br />[5C2005-01-27

He investigates and is shot in the head.  He survives, but his young wife is killed.  This book had a promising beginning, but the plot was transparent and the pace dragged considerably at times.  I did like the character, Archie, but the detective investigating the case, Merci Rayborn, was mostly just annoying.  Frequent references to Merci's mysterious past were intriguing at first, then tedious.  I am a big fan of T.

Brown goes right to the heart of the battle between religion and science.  I don't want to ruin it for other readers by giving away too many details, but there were a few interesting facts (?) put forward.  (I wonder how many readers pulled out a one-dollar bill to study the back after Langdon's explanation of the symbols.  I did.)  This was a fairly interesting read, but I found myself skimming pages at about the halfway point.  The scene in the Church archives was particularly tedious.  The pace picked up considerably toward the end and led to a very exciting conclusion.  If I hadn't read and enjoyed The Da Vinci Code, I doubt I would have chosen to read Angels And Demons.  I thought The Code was much better.[C2004-10-04

They begin the investigation, then Sara's sister is viciously attacked and the suicides are starting to look suspicious.  They may be homicides.  Some of the characters that people this book are pretty strange.  I didn't realize this was a continuation in a series until I was well into the story.  Maybe I would have had more sympathy for the reoccurring characters if I had read the previous books.  I had a problem believing in Sara Linton as a doctor.  I may be unfairly comparing her character to that of Gwen Hunter's Dr. Rhea Lynch who seems to me a very competent doctor.  There are several very graphic descriptions of the crime scenes and some fairly explicit sex scenes, that might not be for everyone.  This was not a comfortable read.  But, like a particularly bad car accident, it was hard to look away.[4C2004-09-24

Parker does a wonderful job of introducing his characters to the reader without a lot of tedious details.  I've read many of Parker's previous novels and it's his writing style that keeps me coming back.  He tells a good story and keeps the pace moving at a good clip.  His characters stay with me long after I've finished a book of his.  I can still remember Silent Joe...one of my favorites.  Tom McMichael will stay with me too.  A decent guy trying to do a good job under difficult circumstances.  A very enjoyable read.[8C2004-09-07

Reichs is very good at character development and she continues to add depth to the characters in this outing.  The plot is interesting and leads to a spectacular conclusion.  There is an irresistible hook at the end of almost every chapter, so if you are going to put this book down, you'll have to do it mid-chapter.  Some readers may find the technical forensic sections a little tedious, but I found them very enlightening.  I prefer the books in this series that take place in Charlotte, North Carolina.  Montreal seems rather dismal to me.  But this is a good addition to the series and adds a lot of depth to the character Tempe Brenan.[7C2004-08-22

That alone is worth the price of admission.  No matter what kind of mood I'm in when I start an Evanovich book, I soon find myself giggling at the antics of Stephanie, her friends and family.  I find myself reading passages out loud to my husband to get him laughing.  In this outing, Stephanie has lost another car to catastrophe and is reduced to driving her late uncle's '53 Buick which gets about 5 miles to the gallon.  A contract is put on Stephanie's life by a local gang.   The plot of this story is a little weak, but that's not why I read an Evanovich book.  It's the journey, not the destination that makes this series so good.  As mentioned by a few other reviewers, the ending di[1;61r[60;91H[1;60r[22S[38;91Hd seem a little abrupt.  I was looking forward to Valerie's wedding (bound to be a lot of fun), but I guess I'll have to wait until the next installment for those laughs.  If you are looking for a deep, meaningful, thought provoking read, you won't find it in this book.  This one is simply good fun.[5C2004-08-06

In a strange twist, it is revealed that another patient of Koppel's was murdered a little over a year ago.  Another murder soon follows.  The first half of this book was great with Milo and Alex tracking down clues.  Then the pace slows a bit and the plot becomes a little scattered.  At first, I thought the international angle was over the top, but by the end it made more sense.  I always enjoy the interaction between Milo and Alex and it was in good supply in this outing.  So, although the story bogged down in places and at times seemed over-complicated, it was an interesting read and the good ending left me satisfied.[5C2004-07-25

He is soon reconnected with Rachel Walling and on the hunt for Richard Backus (The Poet).  I read both of these previous novels (and saw the movie Blood Work) and although I would recommend reading these books because they are so good, I think this story can stand alone.  Connelly gives enough background to set the stage for this story.  And I really appreciate that he gets the reader up to speed without a lot of tedious details.  Connelly cuts to the chase and what a chase it is!  Suspense and action fill the pages from beginning to end.  Michael Connelly finds just the right mix of beautiful prose and gritty reality.  Harry Bosch is a complicated and interesting character.  I've read all of the books in the Bosch series and Harry is still a mystery to me....as it should be.  An excellent addition to the series and I look forward to the next glimpse into the fascinating world of Harry B.[6C2004-07-03

In Coben's past novels his main characters have been men who have to do battle with evildoers.  I was curious to see how he handled a woman as the hero.  In past outings, Coben's male heroes bumble around, get lucky and save the day.  Grace Lawson is considerably stronger and smarter.  This makes for a more believable tale.  Toward the end of the story, I thought the conclusion was going to be disappointing....too simple.  But there were several surprising twists that made for a very satisfying ending.  This was a fast paced and very entertaining read.[8C2004-06-11

It's been quite some time since I read the first Liam Campbell novel, but I had no trouble picking up the story.  The first one third of this book was very good, but then the pace became a little uneven.  Although the relationship between Liam and his girlfriend, Wy was enjoyable early on, towards the end it became tedious...interrupting the hoped for conclusion to the mysteries.  The humor with which Liam faces life and the good plot twists toward the end saved this one from being a total wash.

I'm not normally a big fan of political thrillers, but Hill made this one interesting.  The characters are complex and the dialog is especially well done.  The story moves along at a good clip and there were frequent hooks to past secrets that kept me turning pages.  There was a bit of graphic sex toward the end, which might not be for everyone.

He is blessed (or cursed) with the ability to see dead people and evil ghost shadows (bodachs).  This story is fast paced and full of great characters.  About halfway through the book, some of the dialog between Odd and his girlfriend, Stormy, struck me as a little silly which was surprising because the writing in the rest of the book was so well done.  Some of the phrasing was really exceptional.  For instance: Odd is trying to fathom why some people get caught up in Satanism...\\"Certain fourteen-year-old boys, yes, because some of them were washed half loose from reason by shifting tides of hormones\\".  It's phrasing like this that makes the journey through this story so enjoyable.  The descriptions included, especially of the bodachs, are so vivid, it's almost like watching a movie.  I do hope a movie is made from this book...it would be a glorious visual experience.  As this story neared it's conclusion it was so intense, it was difficult to resist peeking ahead to check out the resolution.  I don't know if Koontz has ever brought back any of his characters for an encore, but I would certainly be interested in any book in the future that features Odd Thomas.  This was an excellent read.[6C2004-01-24

One day he gets the bright idea to hack into the company's computer system to pay for a retirement party for a friend of his who works on the loading docks.  It's a great party, but he gets caught.  He is given the choice of going to prison or going to work for his boss's competitor and providing him with valuable corporate secrets.  Adam chooses to become a spy.  The level of interest never wanes.  This is a fast-paced, action-filled story.  Adam Cassidy is a strong and likable character and carries the story well.  With books like this, as I near the end, a conflict occurs.  I want to slow down and make the book last awhile longer, but I'm eager to read faster to discover how the story resolves.  I wasn't successful at going slow.  This book is better than a hot fudge sundae and it's impossible to make it last.  Be prepared for an unusual ending.  A very good read.[2C2004-01-14

It's one year later and another hot summer in Boston.  Detective Jane Rizzoli is on the trail of a killer who's crimes bear a similarity to the Surgeon who she helped put behind bars the previous summer.  In this outing, the attention centers more on Rizzoli. Her prickly nature is a little off-putting at first, but I grew to like and admire her as the story progressed.  I did miss Detective Thomas Moore who played a large part in the previous book.  I found myself anxious to resume reading each time I had to put this book down.  It held my interest throughout and the action was non-stop. The content is fairly grizzly and might not be for everyone.  I would strongly recommend reading The Surgeon before picking this one up.  As a sequel, it lived up to all of my expectations.  A very good read.[6C2003-10-04

I didn't think the level of suspense could be sustained for 450 plus pages, but it was.  There is a suspenseful hook on almost every other page.  Well-drawn characters, believable dialog, and a crisp writing style combine to make this fast paced story hard to put down.  I can't speak for the accuracy of the `facts' presented in this book, but as a mystery/thriller it works extraordinarily well.  I was a little skeptical of all [1;61r[60;2H[1;60r[22S[38;2Hthe hype surrounding this book and the many glowing reviews, but I was not one bit disappointed.  An exceptionally good read.[2C2003-09-19

He discovers his neighbor's dog killed with a pitchfork and decides to solve this mystery.  The view of the world through the eyes of an autistic child is very enlightening and well presented by the author.  About halfway through the book, the dog's murderer is revealed and one of the hooks for the story is lost, but it sets up the plot for the second half of the story.  Fear is the major motivation in Christopher's life and he shows a great deal of courage in overcoming his fears.  At times Christopher's ramblings were repetitive and tedious.  His emotional disconnection to the people in his life was disturbing and very depressing.  I was impressed with the idea for this book.  It is an ambitious attempt to understand the workings of the autistic mind. However, the later stages of this story were rather dark and I was relieved to have finished it and to get my mind back to my `normal' life.[6C2003-09-06

I haven't read any of Koontz's books for quite some time because they were beginning to seem too much alike to me.  This one, however, struck me as fresh and original.  I liked the characters, especially Ethan Truman, the ex-cop and head of security for Channing  Manheim the famous actor who is called The Face.  I thought it curious that The Face was chosen for the title because he had very little to do with the story.  I'm glad I gave Dean Koontz another chance to entertain me.

As Ryan arrives in Charlotte to whisk Tempe away, body parts start turning up requiring Tempe's attention.  I guess that viewed from a distance, the various parts of the plot and all the coincidences make sense, but at first glance it all seems pretty far-fetched.  There are numerous characters that require the reader's close attention just to keep track of them.  However, I did enjoy this story.  I especially liked the antics of Boyd, the chow who has a newly discovered talent.  Apparently he very good at sniffing out cadavers.

I was frequently tempted to peek ahead a few pages to learn the resolution of some of the situations.  I didn't, however, care for the evidence charts included at intervals.  They were redundant and the print was too small for me to read comfortably.  I found I could skip these charts and follow the story just fine.  This was a very clever thriller with a clever plot and several clever characters.

Several murders in Laramie are starting to look similar to Burns.

As Burns gathers evidence to support his theory, he has to deal with some very serious personal issues.  McKenzie weaves an ambitious plot that comes together in an action filled conclusion.  Rock climbing scenes interspersed with courtroom drama keep the reader interested throughout the story.  Anton Burns is a great character and I would welcome more stories about him.  However, my favorite character in this book is Ozo, Burns' Mastiff-type dog, who goes everywhere with him.  Ozo even `spots' Anton on his solo climbs.  Put a dog in a story, any story, and you have won me over.  This was a very good debut novel.[8C2003-07-15

It is not exactly an original [1;61r[60;196H[1;60r[24S[36;196Hplot, but MHC is such a good storyteller she makes it seem fresh.  She reveals just enough to keep the reader guessing to the end. Carley seemed a little too sweet at times, but believable for the most part. The medical aspects of the story were sometimes vague and imprecise, but that was easy to overlook because the plot was the star of this book and if some of the parts didn't ring true, all can be forgiven for dramatic effect.  One of my favorite lines was, \\"A good night's sleep means that all parts of my brain come awake at the same time\\".

An expert from the Vatican arrives on the scene to determine its authenticity.  The reader is left to wonder what is this newly discovered artifact and how did it come to be in this place.  The story begins in the year 1096 and tells of the amazing adventures of an ordinary innkeeper during the time of the Crusades and the time after he returns to his home.  This is not a detailed historic novel.  It is a fairly interesting lightweight read.  The pace is fast and is spurred on more by the wonderful characters than by the story line.  Every once in awhile a word or phrase would pop up that seemed odd.... too modern for the times.  That was a small distraction.  There is quite a bit of violence throughout this book, but that is a reflection of the medieval times.  This story was a little reminiscent of the movie, Indiana Jones And The Last Crusade.  There was violence in the movie as well, but Indy used a gun most of the time.  So much neater than all those swords, arrows and axes.[2C2003-04-06

I enjoyed the two previous novels in this series and I think Deadly Remedy is even better.  I continue to be amazed at the precise detail involving the many medical emergencies described by Hunter.  In this outing, Rhea gets up close and personal with faith healers and practitioners of black magic.  The action never lets up.  The characters come to life effortlessly.  The dialog absolutely sparkles.  And I love Belle and Pup, Rhea's two heroic dogs.  All these ingredients make for a fast paced page-turner.  Although there are some references to the story lines in the previous novels, I think this book can stand alone.  However, I would recommend reading Hunter's earlier books just because they are so very good.[C2003-03-06

I was hesitant to invest in this one, but the premise sounded interesting.  It could have been a good story, but I found myself struggling to get through it.  I thought it was just me...maybe too many distractions just now.  But after reading some of the other customer reviews, I see that I was not alone.  There are the usual tedious descriptions of life's minutia common to Grafton's books, but what is worse, the entire story is flat and plod[1;61r[60;120H[1;60r[22S[38;120Hding without any spark.  If this was a debut novel by an unknown author, it would go straight to the discount table in the bookstore.

She said, among other things, that it grabbed her from the start and she remembered the characters long after she finished the book.  Since these are qualities I look for in a book, I was anxious to read this, Mary Lawson's debut novel.  There is much to recommend in this book.  A good story, well told and characters who get into your heart and stay there.  Although part of the story is tragic, Lawson lightens the mood with well placed humor.  The antics of Kate's younger sister Bo are particularly endearing.  There is a mystery here and Lawson knows exactly how much to reveal to draw the reader along.  I enjoyed this story very much and I'm looking forward to more stories from Mary Lawson.[3C2003-02-03

It was apparently, someone he trusted.  With the introduction of each new character, the reader is left to wonder, is this the murderer?  Dr. Peter Pavanno enters the picture two days later to interview for a position on the team.  Questions soon arise concerning the cardiac cartel and Peter finds first his job, then his life threatened.  The first part of the book follows a familiar formula.  Then about halfway through the story it begins to get more interesting.  There is plenty of action and it is nice to be able to root for a deserving hero such as Peter Pavanno.  There are quite a few typos that were a little distracting, but they didn't slow the pace of the story.  Although this isn't a very original tale, it was an enjoyable read.[2C2003-01-15

Kincaid soon discovers that he is being used.  Conspiracy and dirty deeds abound.  A large part of this story involves detailed, technical gene science.  This is not a lightweight read.

She takes us back 113 years to the Jack The Ripper murders and paints a very interesting picture of the people and places of that time.  Using letters, newspaper articles and police reports, she builds a case against the artist Walter Sickert.  I personally found Cornwall's conclusions believable....much more so than other theories I have heard.  Reading this account of events was like being a juror and hearing the prosecution's case.  It will be interesting to see how many defense `attorneys' will come forward to present an opposing view.  Some of the crime scene pictures included in the book are not for the faint of heart.  I would have liked to see more examples of Walter Sickert's paintings, but that might have been difficult to arrange.  They are available from other sources of course.  Cornwall has a disconcerting habit of introducing a piece of information then dropping it, only to reintroduce it later with a more complete explanation.  Although the story is not told in true chronological order, the whole picture does come together eventually.  Whether you agree or disagree with the author's findings, this book makes for a fascinating read.[4C2002-11-29

Psychologist Alex Delaware and Detective Milo Sturgis have paired up to solve a 20 year old murder.  Alex's girlfriend Robin is, thankfully, out of the picture for most of this one. There is just too much angst in their relationship, as far as I am concerned.  This mystery is mainly twofold.  Who was responsible for the murder 20 years ago and who sent Alex the murder book, which in effect reopens the case.  Milo Sturgis is one of my favorite characters and I was pleased to find he played a major role in this story.  The frequent and extensive Internet searches were a little tedious, but that might just be me.  I detest doing searches.  I like a nice, tidy ending, and this one filled the bill, although it did seem a little forced.  This story was more like Kellerman's earlier work and a very enjoyable read.[5C2002-11-20

But, after reading the customer reviews (some of them positively glowing), I decided to give it a try.  The story was sad, but it was also uplifting.  As I understand it, the author was raped when she was in college and wrote about that life staggering episode in her memoir, Lucky.  Perhaps that is the reason the description of Susie Salmon&#146;s rape and murder was so powerful.  After her murder, Susie wanders her version of heaven and keeps watch over those left behind on earth.  It is difficult to say more about the tale without giving away the plot.  There are parts of the book that drag on a little, but ultimately, it&#146;s the story and the strong characters that pull the reader along.  This is an original and thought provoking story.  I found myself wondering about loved ones I have lost.  Are they watching over me?  I sometimes think this is true and it is a comforting thought that Alice Sebold&#146;s story has reinforced.[2C2002-11-11

Some reviewers have focused on the intriguing relationship between Carter and President Warren G. Harding, but I found the first chapter most interesting. Unforeseen circumstances have nine year old Charles and his younger brother, James, alone and marooned in the family house for five days while an unusually harsh storm envelopes San Francisco.  It sets the scene for what follows, which is a rich and delicious tale.  In the book description, it says this story is a mix of fact and fiction.  As I said, I knew little of Charles Carter so I don't know what, in the book, is actual fact and what is fiction.  But it made for a very entertaining read and I was sorry to see it come to an end...I wanted more.  I may have to read this one again...it was that good.[2C2002-10-24

They have been the caretakers of a classic Buick 8 Roadmaster since 1979.  It resides in shed B at the troop barracks.  The story unfolds as told to young Ned Wilcox by the present day troopers who have seen some strange sights concerning the Buick over the years.  The narrative shifts back and forth among the characters, as it would with any group of people relating a story they all witnessed, and it lends a reality to the telling.  This story is vintage Stephen King and it has it all.... intriguing story line, strong and likable characters, and, as always, exceptionally good dialog.  I always read the author's note at the end of a SK book before I begin the story and would recommend other readers do the same for this book.  Nothing in the note gives away the plot and in learning how the story came into being makes the tale even more interesting.  I, like many of SK's readers, was devastated to learn he is going to retire from writing.  I have read all of his books and have been entertained by them from beginning to end.  This book was one of his best, in my opinion, and the ending was a hum-dinger.  Only fitting, I suppose.[6C2002-10-11

The beginning...the prolog of the `book within a book'...was very good.  I was intrigued and found the character description of the crusty old sailor quite appealing.  But the rest of the story was a let down.  The writing was okay and the pace moved along at a pretty good clip, but the story line was lightweight and predictable.  It wasn't a total waste of time.

If you are a fan of forensic thrillers and the TV show CSI, you will probably enjoy this book.  Some parts may be a little gruesome for the unprepared reader.  Reichs goes into quite a bit more detail involving forensic testing which some might find tedious.  I, however, am a forensic junkie and found it fascinating.

These characters are so well defined they seem plucked from real life.  I was surprised at how much I came to care about them.  I found it difficult to put this book down.  Evans keeps the interest alive throughout the whole story.  There isn't one single dull patch.  The landscape descriptions are so well written it is like looking at a picture rather than just reading about it.  The smoke jumper scenes were like being there.  My only criticism is for the first chapter, probably because it wasn't what I was expecting.  It was sad and somewhat depressing.  I think that this part of the story would have been better told in flashback fashion after the main characters had been introduced.

There are a series of paintings of nude women who appear to be asleep or dead on display in a gallery in Hong Kong.  Jordan Glass, a world class photo journalist, discovers the paintings and is shocked to discover that one of them looks exactly her.  The first page in this book is a little tricky.  I wonder how many readers go back and read the first two paragraphs a second time before continuing with the story.  Iles, in the tradition of the best mystery writers, doesn't come right out and tell the reader who the suspect could be, but he paints a picture and leaves it to the reader to pick up on his clues.  So much more fun that way.  There are ups and downs in this story.  It bogs down in a few places, but the pace soon picks up again.  At times, the suspense is so great, the reader is tempted to take a peek at the end.  But it's a complicated story and the reader would miss out on a lot by doing that.

He sets out to prove that there are unsafe conditions and toxic waste at the mine.  His efforts do not endear him to the people in the community where many are dependent on the mining company for their livelihood.  Okay, this is not an original premise, but Palmer soon takes this story in a different direction.  A believable and frightening direction.  Omnivax, a vaccine with 30 different components, is about to be approved for use worldwide.  One of the components was tested in Belinda 10 years ago and the adverse reactions are just beginning to show up.  This is an ambitious plot line that tends to bog down about midway through the book, but Palmer manages to bring it all together in the end.  There are likable heroic characters (the Slocumb brothers were my favorite), evildoers that were a little over the top, several good action scenes (involving motorcycle chases) and two very good field surgery scenes.  The dialog was, at times, at little hard to take.  Too sappy for my taste (does anyone say \\"pshaw\\" anymore?).

Thankfully, at the front of the book, there is a list of family members, servants and other assorted people connected to the family.  Lord and Lady Berrybender have fourteen children in all, but not all of them are traveling with them.  I did think it odd that of the children listed, Brother Seven was only briefly mentioned and Sister Ten was not included in the story at all (after the first few of their children were born, Lord Berrybender decided to give his children numbers instead of names).  This is mainly a character driven story (most of the characters being extremely unlikable).  Finally, towards the end of the book, a blizzard hits and the story takes off and turns (all to briefly) interesting.  I am curious to discover what becomes of this strange and bawdy bunch of folks, so I will probably give the second installment a read.  I am hoping it will be better than this one.[3C2002-07-23

I couldn't help but compare them to the characters in the TV show, \\"Sex In The City\\".  The city is San Francisco and there is little or no sex going on, but the character's relationships are adolescent and the dialog between them is atrocious (\\"The margarita posse rides again\\".  Yikes!).  They set out to solve the mystery of a serial murder who is killing black cops and their relatives.  The mystery itself is a good one and kept me interested.  When it is seemingly solved, there are about 60 pages left so I realized a large red herring had been served up.  The plot saved this story from being a total washout, but these characters left a lot to be desired.  I can understand Patterson's desire to branch out into different scenarios (I was getting a little tired of Alex Cross too), but he took a wrong turn with this one.[4C2002-07-18

She is strong/weak, tough/vulnerable, and a little crude.  I didn't like her very much at first, but as the story evolved, I found myself liking her more and more.  Three years earlier she was on the bomb squad when a bomb unexpectedly exploded and killed her partner/secret lover and nearly killed her.  She survived with some terrible scars and is still trying to deal with it and not doing very well.  Her job is all she thinks she has left and she's barely holding it together.  Then another man on the bomb squad is killed by a bomb.  This leads Starky on a perilous trail to discover who is responsible.  Along the way, she meets Special Agent Jack Pell of the ATF and her personal life is turned upside down.  This is a wonderfully plotted mystery with many interesting characters.  The suspense is sustained to a tension filled ending.  An excellent read.[5C2002-07-16

Goldie's husband, Tom, is out of town on police business.  Someone shoots out the front window of the house.  Not a pleasant way to wake up.  The scene then shifts to a transplanted castle where Goldie has two scheduled catering events coming up.  Descriptions of the old English castle were a little tedious in the beginning, but later proved to be essential to the mystery, so I'm glad I paid attention.  A map would have been helpful.  This was act[1;61r[60;26H[1;60r[22S[38;26Hually a very good mystery.  Plenty of separate investigations for Goldie to pursue.  I have to agree with some of the other reviewers here, that the characters do seem to be turning a little stale.  I wish Goldie would stop referring to her ex-husband as The Jerk.  It just seems rather juvenile.  The recipes, as always, sound scrumptious.  I didn't think I would be interested in recipes for the Elizabethan period, but Davidson has presented them in an updated form.  For instance, Kidney Pie has been turned into Shakespeare's Steak Pie.  I'm anxious to give that and the Plum Tart a try.  I guess this would be described as a \\"cozy mystery\\".  It was enjoyable, if not exactly riveting.  As Goldie finds comfort in food prep, I find comfort in reading about it.[7C2002-07-10

She is branching out in this episode to help a friend in trouble.  Others have said this is a darker story than Evanovich's previous novels.  I can't agree.  I burst out laughing after reading the first line in this book and the laughs continued through the whole story.  I keep expecting to hear that JE has branched out and is now doing stand up comedy.  The sexual tensions involving Ranger and Morelli continue.  Personally, I hope this never gets resolved...so much more fun this way.  A new character, Jeanne Ellen Burrows, was very intriguing.  It will be interesting to see if she returns in future stories.  I hope so.  I liked her.  The plot line in this story is a little weak, but that's not why I enjoy this series so much.  I like to laugh and Evanovich does it for me every time.[5C2002-07-03

His care of one of the boy's bones, laying in a shoebox (he keeps his hand over it as he drives) broke my heart.  There is a lot of police procedural and politics in this outing, but I thought it made the story more believable.  It also made me appreciate the hard work that the real police do.  It is not all glamorous action.  The twists and turns in the mystery kept me interested.  Just about everything that can go wrong in an investigation, goes wrong in this one.

This is a complicated mystery with many twists and turns.  Coben's subtle humor is sprinkled throughout and tends to ease the tension somewhat.  Will Klein, our hero, is very believable as a sometimes brave and sometimes clueless guy.  I found the jumping from one scene to another a little disruptive and there were a few noticeable errors.  On two different occasions, a character would sit down, then a few lines later, would sit again.  This story wasn't quite as good as Tell No One, but it was still a very good read.  If you can follow the many twists and turns, you will be rewarded with a snap-crackling good conclusion.[3C2002-06-22

I have no experience with guns, gunfights, or gangsters, but I do know an entertaining read when I come across one and this was great entertainment.  Earl Swagger, just home from fighting in WWII, heads up a team of men reminiscent of the \\"Untouchables\\" to clean up the town of Hot Springs, Arkansas which is rife with gangsters, gambling and prostitution.  Earl is a somewhat dark character except when he is doing his job...training his team of law enforcers and taking out bad guys.  When he is in his element, he is downright jovial.  Earl's wife, June, is less well developed and the author made some errors in writing about her pregnancy and delivery (A face down presentation is normal.  A face up presentation would be a problem.  And, as any woman who has given birth could tell you, ten centimeters is the magic number for cervical dilation, not twelve to fifteen.).  But since this is, in large part, a \\"guy book\\", these errors do not distract from the major story line.  There is plenty of exciting action to keep the reader interested.  I have been a fan of Stephen Hunter's since \\"Black Light\\" and I enjoy his writing style very much.  This is a very good addition to the Swagger saga.[6C2002-06-05

It held my interest so I could overlook a lot of its problems.  This isn't a very well written book.  The dialog, in particular, doesn't always ring true and in fact, is a little annoying at times.  However, the premise is interesting and well presented.  The suspense is unrelenting and the characters are well developed.  Carl, who has Alzheimer's disease, is especially realistic.

The tale begins on an interesting note, but the pace soon begins to lag.  There are some interesting characters here, but for some reason I just couldn't connect with the main character, Kirsten/Peyton.  The first person narrative seemed awkward to me.   I kept reading because I was curious to learn the outcome of Lauren's pregnancy.  I was rewarded with a short, fast paced conclusion, but the birth of Lauren and Alan's baby was glossed over.  I have enjoyed most of Stephen White's previous novels, but this one just wasn't my cup of tea.[4C2002-05-15

She makes a wonderful centerpiece for this tale.  The medical aspect of the story is very well done.  Microbiology is not always an easy subject to grasp, but Hunter does an excellent job in her descriptions of the \\"bugs\\" as well as the effect they have on the human body.  There are a few red herrings in this mystery, but it all comes together in a slam bang conclusion.  Some of the characters and situations from the first book are carried over into this story, so for a clear picture of the chain of events, it would probably be a good idea to read these books in chronological order.

An interesting way to look at the relationship between reader and writer.  The more I thought about it, the more sense it seemed to make.  And this date was definitely fun. In the opening story, \\"Autopsy Room Four\\", SK preys on what I think must be a universal fear.  It sets the pace for the following stories.  I love short story collections and this will be counted among my favorites.  Even the stories I had previously read were worth a second read.  It amazes me how much more I can get out of a SK story the second time around.  I enjoyed all 14 of these stories, but I think \\"The Little Sisters Of Eluria\\" was my favorite.  It involves Roland (the gunslinger) from the Dark Towers series.  It has made me impatient for the next installment of the Dark Towers, which SK has promised will be available soon.

Anna Pigeon is again forced to deal with the established \\"ol' boy's network\\" while she tries to solve the murder of Doyce Barnette, the brother of the local mortician.  Some of the characters in Deep South are revisited...Randy Thigpen, Barth Dinkins and Anna's love interest, Sheriff Paul Davidson.

That is just one example of how real to life Barr has managed to make these characters.  There are some of Barr's trademark descriptions of the surrounding landscape; maybe not as much as in her previous books, but what is included is quality.  She uses descriptions of smells (pine, moldy leaves, etc.) more than any author I can think of, and it sounds a little odd, I know, but that, more than anything else, brings me instantly into each scene.  I enjoy NB's sense of humor and it is sprinkled sparingly throughout this story, but I long for more.  It's difficult to avoid comparing one book to another in a series such as this.  I admit I have done so on occasion.  But I think this book stands on it's own and can and will be enjoyed by readers who are new to this author.  However, for those readers who haven't read Nevada Barr's previous books, you are in for a real treat.[8C2002-04-05

He delivers a short story here with plenty of punch.  All that is lacking is the campfire and marshmallows.  The setting, in front of a live audience, adds to the pleasure.  As is often the case with King stories, the tale starts off on a humorous note and then delivers the horror toward the end.  It is obvious King has spent some time observing cats and dogs.  He paints a very real picture of animal behavior in this story.  There is some rough language which may be offensive to some listeners.  It is a short story and I plan to listen to it again and again to see if I missed anything the first time around.  Knowing SK as I do, I'm sure there are hidden meanings lurking everywhere.[4C2002-04-04

It had been so long since the last installment, however, that I had almost forgotten just how much I enjoy these stories.  After reading the first page, I remembered all the reasons I love Diana Gabaldon's books.  Her writing is beautiful and pulls the reader right into these character's lives.  Her descriptions are so vivid, it is like watching a movie unfold rather than having to imagine the scene. For an example of her descriptive writing style; Brianna is a wee bit upset with Roger: \\"She drew a deep breath through her nose, like a dragon preparing to sear him into ash\\".  No imagination necessary, the scene is there for the reader to vi[1;61r[60;64H[1;60r[22S[38;64Hew.<br />It has been almost four years since I read Drums Of Autumn and after about 70 pages into this book, I realized I needed help (my memory is not as good as I thought it was).  So, I ordered the Outlandish Companion (rush delivery) to use as a reference to some of the characters and some of the previous pivotal incidents.  It was a big help and I would recommend it to fans of this series.  There were a few sections (most in the first half of the book) where the pace slowed considerably.  At the `Gathering', I think the author wanted to establish a sense of community, but the descriptions of all the characters here were rather tedious and ultimately not essential.  The most interesting parts of the story, for me, were Claire's use of her 20th century medical knowledge and her clever adaptations to her present situation.  The use of herbs and medical techniques was more prominent in this book than in earlier stories.  I won't make the mistake of giving this book away, as I did with the previous books.  I will keep it for reference when the next book is published.  It is a handsome book.  The pages have a semi-slick feel to them, the print is small but elegant, and at 979 pages, the hardcover edition will almost certainly improve the muscle tone in the armsof the reader.  Claire and Jamie are wonderful characters and their charm has not diminished.  Now, Brianna, Roger and  Jemmy have risen to the same cherished  level.  I was going to give this book four stars because the pace did slow significantly in a few places, but in considering the Herculean effort of the author to write a story of this magnitude (to say nothing of the entire series), I decided that should count for something.  So, five stars it is.[6C2002-02-11

Adopted by Will Trona (a policeman) and his wife Mary Ann when he was five, he now works full time in the Sheriff's department in Orange County, California and part time as a sort of assistant to his father who is now a county supervisor.  There is something wrong with Joe's face and early in the story the reader is tantalized with the mystery of how this came to be.  Joe is a fearsome looking character and he is well-trained in methods of destruction and self-defense. He is also very proud of his good manners (he feels that it makes for a good balance).  As the story begins, tragedy strikes...Will Trona is murdered and Joe sets out to find answers.  In an early scene in the book, Parker gives the reader a very clear picture of Joe's character.  As Joe carries his dying father toward the doors of the emergency room:  \\"I slipped to my knees but kept him balanced because it was the only thing I could do for him and I wanted to do it well\\".  I surprised and embarrassed myself by bursting into tears at that point.  I've been a fan of T. Jefferson Parker's since his first book.

It's been awhile since I've read a true crime novel. Most of the reading I engage in now is fiction, so Crowley's journalistic writing style took some getting used to. Early on, his writing seemed rather choppy and abrupt. Facts were bluntly stated with no follow up.  It was left up to the reader to fill in the rest of the picture.  It's not bad, just different than the narrative used in most fiction. It may have been Crowley's attempt to remain unbiased, because later in the book, when he was expressing his own opinions, the writing was smoother.  I had trouble feeling any sympathy for the victim (Gail Katz Bierenbaum).  She was portrayed, for the most part, as a self-centered, spoiled brat.  Her husband, Bob, was more complicated...a socially inept genius in the beginning and then an evil psychopath later on.  It seemed to me that Crowly was out of his depth when he was describing the psychological profiles of Gail and Bob.  Apparently Bob was diagnosed with \\"untreatable  psychopathy\\" after just one visit to a psychiatrist.  Psychopathy is a very broad  term that includes many forms of mental illness and it would be irresponsible for a doctor to determine  untreatably after one visit.  A turning point in the book occurred with the disappearance of Gail.  The author seemed to be on firmer ground when discussing actual evidence.  The courtroom scenes brought together a lot of loose ends.  Despite a shaky start, Crowley delivers an interesting story and leaves the reader with several unanswered questions to ponder.[C2001-10-21

Her life has been shaped by a brutal assault and rape when she was young.  Now, at age 31, she has worked her way back to a fairly normal life.  She is strong, capable, and a little prickly, but likeable.  In this, the third book of the series, Lilly has returned to her hometown for her sister's wedding.  Along with her boyfriend, Jack (a private investigator), she is trying to piece together several recent murders in town that may or may not be related to a child abduction eight years previously. The premise for this story is a good one and it is very well plotted, but it is the characters that make it special.  I haven't read the two previous books in this series, but I didn't feel lost.  In fact, the references to past events just added a little more mystery.  I am looking forward to getting to know these characters better in the earlier and future books in this series.[2C2001-10-18

Unusual, but I liked it.  It reminded me of the camera effects in some films.  It gives an overview of events that even the main principles in the story are unaware of.  It gave me a feeling of \\"being in the know\\".  This is not one of SK or PS's kinder, gentler stories.  There is enough gruesome gore to give the reader nightmares for several nights.  So, this book might not be for everyone, but there is enough `normalcy' to save it from being unpalatable.  The main characters are extremely appealing.  Jack Sawyer is especially winning.  I read the Talisman many years ago and considered re[1;61r[60;28H[1;60r[23S[37;28Hreading it before starting this book, but I didn't.  I found The Black House stands on it's own.  There are enough clues and references to the former story to make the connections.  My only complaint is the use of the silly German accent (which really isn't German) of a few of the characters.  Trying to interpret what is being said slowed the flow of the story.  But that complaint is a small one and I found this story well worth the time it took to read...no small thing at 600 plus pages.[6C2001-10-15

The story of Ruth, the daughter, is told in the third person and the story of her mother, Lu Ling, is told in the first person. Some reviewers have been critical of this form, but I thought it brought the story together beautifully.  As soon as Tan introduces a character to the story, the image of that character stays with the reader through the whole story, so skillful is she in her descriptions.  Little things give insight to the main characters.  For instance; Ruth is trying to decide if she should buy flowers at the grocery store and if she does, what kind should she get?  She agonizes over this decision and finally decides to buy flowers that have \\"lasting value\\".  Tan obviously chooses each and every word she uses with great care.  It makes reading every sentence a true joy.  I seldom read a book more than once, but I'll keep this one and read it again.  It has lasting value.[6C2001-10-03

There are three intertwined mysteries that are very well plotted and plenty of action, including a breathtaking car chase. The dialog is snappy and believable.  The majority of the characters are well defined.  The \\"bad guy\\" characters are a little fuzzy, but that may have been intentional. (When the character, Dex Bartholomew was introduced into the story, an image of Ross Perot popped into my head.  I wonder if anyone else experienced that.)    The story centers around Cynthia Decker, rookie cop, daughter to Peter Decker and stepdaughter to his wife Rina.  Cindy isn't easy to like but she is interesting.  In fact, she is a gold medal brat for most of the story. Toward the end of the book, when it is obvious where the finger of blame is pointing, the question of how it will be resolved keeps the reader's interest alive.  I've read and enjoyed Faye Kellerman's earlier books, but I haven't been keeping up with the series.  I think I have three or four of her books in a stack around here somewhere.  I'll have to go and find them and do some catching up.[7C2001-09-24

A young girl has attempted suicide in the Delphi Caf and Tory is off in search of answers. I found a few problems with this, the sixth and most recent of the Tory Bauer Mysteries. I have always enjoyed Tory's introspective breaks in previous novels. They are often humorous and surprisingly insightful. But I think Ms. Taylor went a little overboard with this particular gambit in the first part of the story. It seemed to take too long to get to the meat of the tale. By the time Tory sits down with her friend, Neil Pascoe (they are a perfect match!), to discuss recent events, the story begins to move along at a more satisfying pace. There were several writing errors throughout the book. A few examples: In one sentence, the word make was used in place of the word may. \\"...lost on the our vast grid...\\". \\"...that it would to be up to me...\\".  There were so many of these small errors it was a distraction. The print on several pages was faint and washed out looking. For people with normal vision, this probably doesn't pose a problem, but my eyesight is less than good and I had some difficulty with it. The story is a very good one and I enjoyed catching up with the folks in Delphi. It is a Not To Be Missed addition to this excellent series. I'm sorry to be so critical here, but I am hoping that word will get back to the publisher that Taylor's books deserve better editing and more attention paid to the actual printing process.[7C2001-08-30

Dr. David Beck's wife was murdered 8 years ago.  He has just received an email that leads him to believe she may still be alive, but he must Tell No One.  The injustices in some parts of this story made me uncomfortable, tense, and even angry.  The police and the FBI suspect Beck of wrongdoing.  Innocent people are murdered to protect the guilty.  The descriptions Beck makes of the abuse suffered by some of his pediatric patients is also hard to take.  It's the surprisingly humorous writing style of Coben's that makes the tension bear[1;61r[60;131H[1;60r[22S[38;131Hable.  In the midst of one particularly tense scene, I actually had to stop and giggle.  The police are chasing Beck and as they begin to close in, Coben writes, \\"The cops were coming closer.  I was totally exposed.  I flattened myself closer to the wall, like that would help.  Like they might turn the corner and mistake me for a mural.\\"  Yes, this is fiction, but Coben brings David Beck and the other characters in this tale to life with style and grace and makes the adventure seem very real.  It seemed I couldn't read fast enough to reach the conclusion, but when I did, I wished I had taken it slower to better enjoy the ride.  I noticed than some of the reviews here are not complimentary.  It might not be everyone's cup of tea, but I really enjoyed it.  In fact, I will go so far as to say, I think this is the best book I have read this year.[8C2001-08-12

Kate Shugak is employed as security to a woman who is campaigning for a Park Senate seat.  About 100 years ago, a \\"working girl\\" falls in love and marries the man who was the highest bidder when she auctioned herself to the men of Dawson.  Stabenow takes us back and forth between these two stories and it becomes clear that a connection will be made.  The pace never falters and the characters, as always, are complete in every detail.  In one part of the book, DS writes about Kate's love of books.  Reading for fun.  Preferring a book to television.  The inability to pass a bookstore without going in. This really struck a chord with me.  I'm just guessing here, but I think Stabenow has endowed Kate with her own love of books.  Maybe that is why she is able to tell such good tales.  She understands readers because she is one herself.  I truely appreciate her efforts, as one reader to another.  Oh, and what about the glove?  Where have I heard about a glove found at the scene of a crime before?  Hummmmm.[5C2001-08-02

Although I missed reading about the folks back in Niniltna, the introduction to the people of Bering was a true joy.  Jim Chopin has a prominent role here and the insights into his character are very reveling.  I also enjoyed a surprising revelation concerning Kate's grandmother, Ekaterina.  The descriptions of Kate's dog, Mutt (one of my favorite characters) are, as always, vivid and alive.  A word of warning: if you are a big fan of the FBI, you should know that the two FBI agents in this story are not portrayed  in a very favorable light. I have read all of Stabenow's previous Kate Shugak mysteries, so it was easy for me to pick up where the story left off last time, but this probably isn't where a reader new to the series should begin.  For a true understanding of Kate, it would be best to start at the beginning (A Cold Day For Murder). It was easy getting into this story and it held my attention throughout. The ending was spectacular.[4C2001-07-25

Or the minute details of her exercise routine?  There was, what seemed to be, a jarring inconsistency early on when Kinsey visits the home of Joel Glazer.  \\"Shafts of sunlight formed geometric patterns on the smooth tile floor\\".

She solves her big problems with bakery items, luck and a little help from her friends.  Grandma Mauzer is one of my favorite characters and she has a prominent role in this installment.

I also appreciated the glossary of plants and herbs that were mentioned in the story.  Despite the fact that I was unfamiliar with these characters and their past history with each other, the story was easy to follow.  I found the details of life in primitive times, in the wilds of Alaska, mesmerizing.  The suspense of what was going to happen to these characters kept me turning pages well into the wee hours.

I am one of those readers who prefer mental/emotional weirdness rather than physical weirdness.  The \\"weasels\\", the aliens, and the red fungus didn't impress me, but I did like the characters and their ability to communicate telepathically.  It is always King's style of writing that wins me over.  Even if the premise or the plot line falls short, the words hold up and draw me irresistibly toward the end.

It's a wild ride, especially toward the end. There is plenty of action and the superior dialog that is DeMille's  trademark.  The story does bog down in a few places.  The tour of the lab on Plum Island, for instance, was probably necessary to the story, but was a little tedious.  However, the clever wit and humor of DeMille's writing helps to pull the reader along.  John Corey is a great new character and I'm looking forward to reading his future adventures.[2C2000-12-16

In this, her fifth novel, she continues the story of the residents of Delphi, South Dakota (and a colorful bunch they are).  It is the New Year and a major blizzard has cut Delphi off from the outside world.  Three strangers, who came into town before the storm hit, are suspect in a number of robberies around town.  One of the strangers turns up dead.  It is up to intrepid waitress, Tory Bauer, to sort things out.  As in other Taylor books, there is plenty of laugh out loud humor and insight into the workings of human nature.  Another winner.[5C2000-11-20

Black Betty does not disappoint.  Easy  juggles several situations at once and manages to bring order and justice  to his world by the end of the book.  I think the most endearing quality of  Easy's is the love and care he gives to his kids, Jesus and Feather.

He's been laying low in England for the past ten years, when he is rudely thrust back into his old life.  What follows is all based on one wrong assumption he makes.  I  was reminded of the time in the movie theater when the man in front of me  got so caught up in the movie, he ac[1;61r[60;100H[1;60r[23S[37;100Htually shouted at the screen, \\"Hey!   You've got it all wrong.  Wake up!\\".  I was about to shout that that at  this book, but I didn't want to startle the dog sleeping at my feet.  I  found the main character appealing even though he is an assassin.  He is,  after all, taking out the bad guys.  There is lots of action and it's fun  to see how he gets out of one scrape after another.  I like the way Thomas  Perry writes.  As with his Jane Whitefield stories (she is a specialist  too.  She helps people disappear) he is clever, witty, sometimes even  humorous, and he doesn't waste my time with unnecessary dialogue or endless  descriptions.  The ending was spectacular.  You really got me with this one  Mr. Perry.[4C2000-05-17

If it can, then this book has it.  The descriptions of the school yard took me back, in a flash, to my elementary school in Long Beach, California years ago.  Do you remember school rooms  in bungalows?  And tetherball?  Mosley is absolutely THE master of  dialogue.  Sometimes too much of one author can get tiresome, but not in  this case.  I read BLACK BETTY just before this book and the dialogue  continues to be fresh and sparkling.  I enjoyed the dry humor sprinkled  throughout the story.  It suits Easy very well and I'd like to see more of  it in future books.  The foray into the culinary experience was another new  addition that I liked a lot.  The main story line held together well and  moved along almost effortlessly.  I finished this book yesterday and I  still don't know how I feel about the ending.  I'm sure it will stay with  me for a long while.  Walter Mosley is one of the best authors around  today, in my opinion.  I eagerly await the next installment in the saga of  Easy Rawlins.[C2000-05-16

The  character, Clara Rinker, was a good one but not strong enough to carry the  story.  I had the impression that Sanford came up with the Rinker character  and tried to build a story around her.  It didn't work.[4C2000-05-01

This book would have  benefited from a better proof reading.  There were quite a few errors  throughout the book, but they really didn't detract from the story.

In the first part of this book, the mystery is, 'where in time are you?'.  McCrumb jumps back and forth over several years  time without giving any clues to the reader.  No headings direct the reader  to time, place or narrator.  I suppose this style is thought to be artsy,  but I found it annoying.  I really couldn't connect with any of the  characters until the father of Frankie Silver came on the scene and he was  only a minor character.

What amazes me about these books is that they read like a serial but any one of them can stand on it's own without any long, detailed introductions or explanations.  Black Betty does not disappoint.  Easy juggles several situations at once and manages to bring order and justice to his world by the end of the book.  I think the most endearing quality of Easy's is the love and care he gives to his kids, Jesus and Feather.  The time spent with his family gives a good balance to the darker side of his life on the streets.  There are some big surprises in this story...some good and some sad and good at the same time.

I've read all of the books in the Malice Domestic series now, one through six, and I'll have to wait until next year for number seven[7C1997-06-07

The stories are short and there is information about each author and the books they've written at the end of each story.

Not always a good reason to buy a book, but in this case it worked out just fine.  Sometimes an author can grab you and put you right into the story at the beginning of a book.  Teri Holbrook does that with Grass Widow.  The atmosphere of the story reminds me a little of Fried Green Tomatoes At The Whistle Stop Caf by Fannie Flagg.  There is more than one mystery to be solved here and the characters involved in doing so are well developed and likable.  I had a little trouble keeping the family members straight...who is who's cousin etc., but then I have that problem with my own family.  I am pleased to have discovered another mystery writer whose future books I can look forward to reading[C1997-05-18

Dean Koontz explains that the reason this book came out in paperback without first being published as a hardcover is because he felt the story was too short to expect readers to pay hardcover pricess.
